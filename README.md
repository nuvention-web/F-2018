A new career is within reach.  Let us help you.

Our current codes were written for our original idea, which involves fetching data from ONet career database and giving personalized recommendations to career switchers.

Now that we switched the direction of our product, and want to build a platfrom for mentors / mentees. Our current product does not use an app built by us - we use Google Form to collect information, and for now we manually match mentor / mentees. We also designed our interface through inDesign. As a result, all technical work will be completed in the Spring quarter.

We placed our deliverables (screenshots & pictures) inside a folder inside of our team folder. Link to the folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1t-BI4vYgO31DzDQJj7uo_EL4_SOC-gLY
